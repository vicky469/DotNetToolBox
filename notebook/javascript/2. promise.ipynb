    "Callbacks and Promises are both patterns for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript, but they have some important differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callbacks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to another function and are executed after some operation has been completed.\n",
    "- Callbacks can lead to \"callback hell\" or \"pyramid of doom\" due to multiple levels of nested callbacks, which can make the code hard to read and understand.\n",
    "- Error handling in callbacks is often done with error-first callbacks, where the first argument is an error object. This can lead to repetitive error handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a callback:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', function(err, data) {\n",
    "  if (err) {\n",
    "    // handle error\n",
    "  } else {\n",
    "    console.log(data);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promises:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.\n",
    "- Promises can be chained together, which can lead to cleaner, more readable code than nested callbacks.\n",
    "- Promises have built-in error handling with the `.catch()` method, which can handle errors from any step in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a promise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n",
    "  .then(response => response.json())\n",
    "  .then(data => console.log(data))\n",
    "  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Promises can make your code more readable and easier to reason about when dealing with complex sequences of asynchronous operations."
