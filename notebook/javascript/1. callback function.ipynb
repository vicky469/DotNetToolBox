    "\n",
    "JavaScript is single-threaded, which means it can only do one thing at a time. However, it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it very efficient for certain types of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make a network request using fetch or XMLHttpRequest, the request is sent off, and then the rest of your code continues to run without waiting for the response. This is the \"non-blocking\" part. Your program doesn't \"block\" or stop to wait for the network request to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the response to the network request is finally received, the callback you provided is added to a queue of tasks to be executed. This is the \"event-driven\" part. The JavaScript runtime environment has an event loop that constantly checks this queue and executes the tasks on it one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while the callback is waiting in the queue and then being executed, the rest of your code can continue to run. This means that the user interface remains responsive and the user can continue to interact with it."
