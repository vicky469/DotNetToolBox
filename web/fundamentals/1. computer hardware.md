# Computer Hardware

The physical elements of a computer.

### circuit board vs computer

- Circuit Board
  - Fixed purpose device  
    The circuits with logic gates have a set of features hard-wired into the design.  
    If we want to add or modify the feature, we have to change the physical design of our circuit.
- Computer  
  A computer must be able to perform new tasks without changing hardware. It needs to add programmability. To accomplish this, a computer must be able to accept a set of instructions (a program) and perform the actions specified in those instructions.

Most processors today are microprocessors, CPUs are on a single integrated circuit.

### Three parts of a computer

1. Main Memory / RAM (random access memory)
2. CPU (central processing unit) / processor  
   carries instructions specified in software  
   have direct access to RAM
3. input/output (I/O) devices
