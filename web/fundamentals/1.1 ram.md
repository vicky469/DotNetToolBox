## 1. Main Memory / RAM (random access memory)

- Stores instructions/programs and related data.
  - For example, when a computer runs a word processor for editing documents, the computer needs a place to hold the program itself, the contents of the document, and the state of editingâ€”what part of the document is visible, the location of the cursor, and so forth.
  - All of this data is ultimately a series of bits that the CPU needs to be able to access.
  - Main memory handles the task of storing these 1s and 0s.
- Think of RAM as a large apartment building with many mailboxes.
  - Each mailbox represents a memory cell which can hold a single byte of data.
    - Each memory cell has a unique address (apartment number).
  - The CPU can read or write to any mailbox by specifying the number of that mailbox.
- Memory Address - Each byte in memory has a unique address. - The CPU can read or write to any byte in memory by specifying the address of that byte.

#### Execution Stack

- The execution stack, also known as the call stack, is a data structure stored in the main memory (RAM) and used by the CPU to keep track of function calls and their corresponding execution contexts.
- When a function is called, its execution context, including local variables and the return address, is pushed onto the stack.
- As the function executes, additional function calls may be made, and their execution contexts are also pushed onto the stack.
- When a function completes, its execution context is popped from the stack, and control returns to the calling function.

#### Heap

- The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- Unlike the stack, which is managed automatically by the CPU, the heap is managed manually by the programmer.
- Memory allocated on the heap can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program.
- The heap is commonly used for storing objects and data structures that need to persist beyond the lifetime of a single function call.
- However, it is important to manage memory on the heap carefully to avoid memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

#### Stack Frame

- A stack frame, also known as an activation record, is a data structure that contains the local variables and other information related to a function call.
- Each function call has its own stack frame, which is pushed onto the execution stack when the function is called and popped when the function completes.
- The stack frame includes the return address, the function's parameters, and the function's local variables.
- The stack frame allows the CPU to keep track of the state of each function call and ensures that local variables are isolated between different function calls.

#### Constant Pool

- The constant pool is a data structure used to store constants, such as string literals and numeric values, that are used in a program.
- Constants in the constant pool are typically referenced by their index, rather than their actual value.

#### Code Segment

- The code segment, also known as the text segment, is a region of memory that contains the executable code of a program.
- The code segment is typically read-only and stores the instructions that the CPU executes.
- When a program is loaded into memory, the code segment is mapped to a specific address range, allowing the CPU to fetch and execute instructions from the code segment.

#### Data Segment

- The data segment, also known as the initialized data segment, is a region of memory that contains global and static variables that are initialized with a value.
- The data segment is typically read-write and stores the initial values of these variables.
- When a program is loaded into memory, the data segment is mapped to a specific address range, allowing the CPU to read and modify the values of global and static variables.

#### Stack Overflow

- Stack overflow occurs when the execution stack exceeds its maximum size.
- This can happen if a program makes too many function calls or if the functions have large local variables.
- When a stack overflow occurs, it can result in a program crash or unexpected behavior.
- To prevent stack overflow, it is important to manage the depth and size of function calls, as well as the size of local variables.
