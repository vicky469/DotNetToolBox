### The problem libuv is trying to solve

All modern operating systems have event notification systems built in. These event notification systems tend to work differently across platforms. This is one of the main issues libuv solves. It provides cross-platform high-level abstractions to handle events, while handling all of the crazy not-so-fun platform differences under the hood. [1]
