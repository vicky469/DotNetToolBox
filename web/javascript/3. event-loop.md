aka the I/O loop

### Motivation

[IO](io.md)

### Design Goals

1. No function should perform io to receive disk or Network information from. You have to have some sort of callback so you can never have that sort of function that makes some query that returns something that's not allowed it should be low level.

2. I should never force the user to buffer data like Ruby on Rails. This should not be included in the low level but should let people to make their application decision.

3. Should not remove any functionality at post POSIX layer, for example have to close TCP connections.

4. Good support on infrastructure low level like TCP, DNS, HTTP.

- HTTP features:
- chunk request/response
- keep alive
- hang request, long pool

API

- timer
  setTimeout

use the original name and form, unless it is a must to change for better.

### How does this work

signal handler

![Image](https://i.gyazo.com/e559f7df7b260e9738fd234f4a8495b1.png)

Interval calls the callback every 500 ms
setup signal handler by adding listener

The process object emit the SIGINT event when it receives the signal, like the DOM to add a listener to catch what the process is doing.

Also:

- process.pid
- process.ENV
- process.cwd()
- process.memoryUsage()

In Node.js, many objects emit events. The `net.Server` object, for example, emits a 'connection' event every time a new connection is made. You can listen for this event by calling the `addListener` or `on` method on the server object and passing it a callback function to be executed when the event occurs.

Here's an example of creating a server and adding a listener for the 'connection' event:

```javascript
const net = require("net");

const server = net.createServer();

server.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.end("Hello World\n");
});

server.listen(8000);
```

However, the `net.createServer` method can also take a callback function as an argument, which it automatically sets as a listener for the 'connection' event. This can simplify the code:

```javascript
const net = require("net");

const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.end("Hello World\n");
});

server.listen(8000);
```
