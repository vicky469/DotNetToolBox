Use cases:

1. Text Search: In a text editor or word processor, you might want to check if a certain sequence of characters (a word
   or phrase) appears in a larger text document. This is essentially a subsequence problem.
2. DNA Sequencing: In bioinformatics, you might want to check if a certain sequence of nucleotides appears in a larger
   DNA sequence. This is also a subsequence problem.
3. User Behavior Analysis: In web analytics, you might want to check if users follow a certain sequence of actions (
   e.g., visit homepage, click on a product, add to cart, make a purchase) on a website. This can be modeled as a
   subsequence problem.
4. Network Packet Analysis: In network security, you might want to check if a certain sequence of network packets, which
   could indicate a security threat, appears in a larger sequence of network traffic. This is another example of a
   subsequence problem.
