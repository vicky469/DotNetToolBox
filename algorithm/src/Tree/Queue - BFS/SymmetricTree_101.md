The `IsSymmetric_BFS` method checks if a given binary tree is symmetric (mirrored around its center) using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]   
Output: true  

isEqual(leftSubtree.left, rightSubtree.right)

Pseudocode:
1. Initialize a queue and add the root node to it.
2. While the queue is not empty:
    1. Record the current size of the queue.
    2. Initialize a list to store the values of the nodes at the current level.
    3. For each node in the current level:
        1. Dequeue a node from the queue.
        2. If the node is not null:  
           - Add the values of its left and right children to the list.
           - Enqueue these children.
    4. Check if the list of node values is symmetric (i.e., it remains the same when reversed).
    5. If the list is not symmetric, return false.
3. If the checks above are all valid, return true.
